### Setting up an Amazon Neptune Cluster

If you don't already have an Amazon Neptune cluster, please refer to the [get started](https://aws.amazon.com/neptune/getting-started/) documentation for Amazon Neptune.


### Downloading the Driver

Download the Neptune JDBC driver [here](https://github.com/aws/amazon-neptune-jdbc-driver/releases). 

The driver is packaged as a single JAR file (e.g., `neptune-jdbc-1.0.0-beta.1-all.jar`).

To connect to Amazon Neptune using the JDBC driver, the Neptune instance must be available through an SSH tunnel, load balancer, or the JDBC driver must be deployed in an EC2 instance.

### Using an SSH Tunnel to Connect to Amazon Neptune

Amazon Neptune clusters are deployed within an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC).
They can be accessed directly by Amazon EC2 instances or other AWS services that are deployed in the same Amazon VPC. Additionally, Amazon Neptune can be accessed by EC2 instances or other AWS services in different VPCs in the same AWS Region or other Regions via VPC peering.

However, suppose that your use case requires that you (or your application) access your Amazon Neptune resources from outside the cluster's VPC. This will be the case for most users not running their application on a VM in the same VPC as the Neptune cluster. When connecting from outside the VPC, you can use SSH tunneling (also known as  _port forwarding_) to access your Amazon Neptune resources.

To create an SSH tunnel, you need an Amazon EC2 instance running in the same Amazon VPC as your Amazon Neptune cluster. You can either use an existing EC2 instance in the same VPC as your cluster or create one.

You can set up an SSH tunnel to the Amazon Neptune cluster `sample-cluster.node.us-east-1.neptune.amazonaws.com` by running the following command on your local computer. The `-L` flag is used for forwarding a local port.

Note: The username of the ec2 connection depends on the type of your ec2 instance. In the below example, we are using Ubuntu.
```
ssh -i "ec2Access.pem" -L 8182:sample-cluster.node.us-east-1.neptune.amazonaws.com:8182 ubuntu@ec2-34-229-221-164.compute-1.amazonaws.com -N 
```

This is a prerequisite for connecting to any BI tool running on a client outside your VPC.

### Adding a SSH Tunnel Lookup

To add to hosts, add the cluster name to your host file (`/etc/hosts` on Mac or `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts` on Windows).
Add the following line to the list of hosts lookup:
`127.0.0.1        <endpoint>`

From our sample above, we would use:
`127.0.0.1        sample-cluster.node.us-east-1.neptune.amazonaws.com`

### Setup Environment for IAM Authentication

First follow the [IAM Authentication setup instructions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-access-keys-best-practices.html#iam-user-access-keys) to configure your system for IAM. 

If you are using IAM authentication, you must set the `SERVICE_REGION` environment variable to an appropriate value (the region you are connecting to, such as `us-east-1`). Or set the appropriate region through the `serviceRegion` connection property as part of the connection string.

**For Mac you must launch your BI tool through terminal to have the environment variables loaded.**
